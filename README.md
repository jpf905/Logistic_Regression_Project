# Logistic Regression Project

A machine learning project utilizing NumPy and Python. We apply gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms. Based on Department of Motor Vehicles written test scores, we utilize Machine Learning and logistic regression (classification) to predict the probability of the student passing.
